### What Does bStats Collect?
bStats does not collect any personal data. Most of the collected data is information about the plugin's server like player count, online mode, Minecraft version, Java version, and more. All data gets sent and stored completely anonymously. Server IPs are only stored for ratelimiting and not linked to the data.
All data that is collected is publicly visible. If you are interested in what data is collected for your Minecraft server, take a look at the pages for the plugins on your server. Please note that plugin authors can also send data that is customized for their plugin. 


### Disabling bStats
If you don't want bStats to collect data from your server, you can disable it in the bStats config file. This file can be found in the /plugins/bStats/ folder.
bStats has nearly no effect on your server's performance and the sent data is completely anonymous. The collected data is important information for plugin authors to improve their plugins and keep motivated. To value their work and effort, please keep bStats enabled.
