# Invisible Item Frames Lite

> Forked from [InvisibleItemFrames](https://github.com/tiffany352/InvisibleItemFrames) by [Tiffany Bennett (Tiffnix)](https://tiffnix.com/contact).

A fast, minimal Spigot plugin that adds **craftable invisible item frames** to your server; no bloated configs, no commands or permissions, just drop it in and go.

## Features
- Adds invisible item frames you can craft and place like normal.
- Frames are visible when empty, and automatically turn invisible once an item is added.
- Perfect for clean builds, displays, or shops without visual clutter.

This isn't a complex plugin; it's a natural extension of Minecraft’s core mechanics.

## Why This Version?
This is an updated, stripped-down fork of the original [InvisibleItemFrames](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/invisible-item-frames.85365/) plugin. We rebuilt this from a
feature-first mindset: keep the good idea, strip away the extra noise. Compared to the original:

- Lightweight performance; tiny, fast, and focused.
- Works right out of the box — no additional configuration needed.
- Compatibility with newer Spigot versions (1.21+)

No command trees. No permission spaghetti. Just craftable invisible item frames that feel like they could've been
shipped natively with vanilla.
